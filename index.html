    <h2 class="h2">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Arielle Shaver</strong> and I'm currently a junior Computer Science major at
       Texas A&M University. I've had about five years of experience working with various 
       computing platforms and applications, and I hope to continue learning how to use 
       even more technologies. Exploring various aspects of Computers and technology has 
       always been my aspiration, and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to do so from several 
       learning experiences. Computers and their functions have always been a fascination of mine, 
       and I've appreciated being able to study various coding languages, software applications, 
       and hardware concepts associated with their design and construction as they relate to computing.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
      After working on a team project where we designed an <strong> <a href="https://csce331-901-01r-tamu.vercel.app/">
      accessible POS system</a> </strong>, I wanted to learn more about <strong> accessible technology </strong> 
      and what impacts or benefits it gives to various individuals around the world. Accordingly, 
      I hope to expand my knowledge and gain new perspectives into the field of Computer Science through 
      taking this accessibility course. In the future I hope that having awareness for accessibility
      can help me be a better engineer and practice the principles of universal and equitable design.
